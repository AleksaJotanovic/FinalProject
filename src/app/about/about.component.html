    <h3>GIVE WITH MEANING</h3>
    <p>
      For over 110 years, as the floral-gifting experts, we’ve been helping you
      give with more care, with greater ease, and with more meaning.
      <br />
      Established in 1910 as a collective of 10 florists, Florists’ Transworld
      Delivery (FTD) used the telegraph to transform the age-old practice of
      flower-giving. We understood then the unique power of flowers to express a
      sentiment and helped people across the world “Say it with flowers.” Today,
      we have grown into an extensive network made up of thousands of local
      florists — each one an artisan who is handcrafting and hand-delivering
      fine bouquets all across the country.
      <br />
      When you’re giving with FTD you’re giving the gift of joy, strength, and
      love and you're giving it with meaning.
